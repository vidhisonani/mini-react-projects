# ⚛️ Mini React Projects

A collection of small **React.js mini projects** created for practice and learning purposes.  
Each project is organized in its own folder with:

- `package.json` & standard React setup  
- `src/` containing components, styles, and logic  
- `README.md` (optional project-specific details)  

The goal of this repository is to provide **hands-on practice with React**, improve **JavaScript skills**, and create a reference collection of mini projects that can grow over time.
